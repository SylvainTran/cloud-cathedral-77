# Cloud Cathedral 77

This is a project in which the format of the medium acts as the message. It's a mythopoeia. The creation of a myth in social media format.

Interact with villagers on Myth Media and watch as the story unfolds.

The experience is about lurking on Myth Media and interacting with a narrative simulation set in a fictive social media context.
