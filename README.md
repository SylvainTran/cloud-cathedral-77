The web app has transformed into a study and translations of classics (Aesop's Fables as a first example) into modern language and social media interfaces.

The project has expanded into including other kinds of translations as well, most of which have some relationship with AI generation (the co-authorship problem between writer X AI). AI is also used as a tool to generate content (multi-modal media - pictures and voice landscapes).
